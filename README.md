In this project, I create a portfolio for myself.

I have done this project on a single page, with each section being the length of the page.
The sections I have in my portfolio are:
 
The home page, where I present my name and my position

The skills page, where I have the languages I know on the screen. If you click on an Icon it displays a bit of background on my knowledge on each language

The About and Contact page, where I display a small paragraph about me and have link to my github, linkedin and email.

The Projects page where I have placeholder images for my projects.
